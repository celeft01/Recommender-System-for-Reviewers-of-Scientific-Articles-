## Introduction

Reviewing scientific articles requires matching reviewers with expertise relevant to the articleâ€™s content. This recommender system automates this process by:

- Identifying suitable reviewers based on keywords and previous publications.
- Utilizing clustering and similarity measures for recommendations.

The system was built with the goal of improving the efficiency and accuracy of the peer review process.

## Features

- **Reviewer Recommendation**:
  - Recommends reviewers based on keywords extracted from the article.
  - Suggests reviewers with prior co-author relationships.

- **Interactive Web Interface**:
  - Search by author names and keywords.
  - Configure the number of recommendations.

- **Backend Processing**:
  - Implements k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) for similarity measurement.
  - Leverages TF-IDF for keyword extraction.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - Bootstrap for responsive design

- **Backend**:
  - Python for data processing and machine learning
  - PHP for server-side scripting

- **Data Science Libraries**:
  - pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy, scipy
